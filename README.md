```ts
import { routeBlocker } from "route-blocker";

const BASE_ROUTE = "api/some-base-route";
export const subRouteToBlock = "some-sub-route";
const myRoute = `${BASE_ROUTE}/${subRouteToBlock}`;

app.use(myRoute, routeBlocker.middleware(subRouteToBlock));
app.get(myRoute, myRouteFunction);
```

In the file where the route blocking should be enabled/disabled
